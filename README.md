# Javascript Questionnaire

Quick practice in building and making use of dynamic JS questionnaire.

Help in practicing my for loops and using this to insert into DOM.

I also had help refactoring this to more friendly and code readable ES6 format.

if you look at app.js vs app_old.js you will see it's quite a difference.

# app.js

- My first attempt was finding an example on web and then using its logic to build my own   questionnaire to practice techniques in JS.  
As you can see it's quite long winded and verbose but in terms of a building a questinnaire that works it did the job.

#app_old.js

- my goal on this tiny project was to look at a way to refactor my codeand make it more friendly, as I knew there was a better way to do this.  I worked on this at a code club with a JS mentor and he showed me how to refactor and make this more readable.

- As you can see I have left a lot of notes for future reference, but take them out and the console logs & compared to my first attempt the code has far less lines and is easier to digest.

- ES6 helps achieve this which is great. From this I have learnt a lot & will attempt to rebuild this project again using the ES6 techniques and understanding how my early attempts were refactored & condensed.

This has helped me look at creating better readable more friendly code.
